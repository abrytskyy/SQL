Question 1(Basic):
Write a SQL Statement that will give you a count of each object type in the AdventureWorks database. Order by count descending.

Hint:
Use the sys.objects table

Solution 1:
select type_desc, count(*) as count_by_type from sys.objects
group by type_desc
order by 2 desc




Question 2(Intermidiate)
Question 2:
a. Write a SQL Statement that will show a count of schemas, tables, and columns (do not include views) in the AdventureWorks database.

b. Write a similar statement as part a but list each schema, table, and column (do not include views). This table can be used later in the course.

Hint:
Either use sys.tables to join sys.columns and sys.schemas.

Or use information_schema.columns, but you will need to remove the view tables (Use information_schema.views).

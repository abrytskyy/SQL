SELECT * FROM payment

SELECT

FROM payment

SELECT 
*
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 4.2006673312979002

--Subqueries in WHERE 
SELECT 
* 
FROM payment
WHERE amount > (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM payment)

-- > = < for 1 single value
SELECT
*
FROM payment
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM customer

--doesnt work for list of multiple value
SELECT
*
FROM payment
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM customer
					WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%')

-- can use IN for multiple value:
SELECT
*
FROM payment
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM customer
					WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%')

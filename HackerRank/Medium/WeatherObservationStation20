A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. 
Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

--Solution 1
SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(median), 4) AS median
FROM (
  SELECT
    LAT_N AS median,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS rownumber,
    COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_rows
  FROM
    STATION
  WHERE
    LAT_N IS NOT NULL
) AS derived
WHERE
  rownumber IN ((total_rows + 1) / 2, (total_rows + 2) / 2)

--Solution 2
SELECT
  round(AVG(median),4) AS median
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      LAT_N AS median,
      @rownum := @rownum + 1 AS rownumber,
      @total_rows := @rownum
    FROM
      STATION,
      (SELECT @rownum := 0) AS dummy
    WHERE
      LAT_N IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
      LAT_N
  ) AS derived
WHERE
  rownumber IN ((@total_rows + 1) DIV 2, (@total_rows + 2) DIV 2)

Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created 
by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of 
challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the 
maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.
Input Format
The following tables contain challenge data:
Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.
Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, and hacker_id is the id of the student who created the challenge.

--Solution
with sub as (select h. hacker_id as h_id, name as n, count(challenge_id) as sum_c_id from Challenges c
left join Hackers h
on c.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
group by h_id, n
order by sum_c_id desc, h_id)

select h_id, n, sum_c_id from sub
where sum_c_id = (select max(sum_c_id) from sub)
or sum_c_id in (select sum_c_id from sub
                group by sum_c_id
                having count(*)=1)
